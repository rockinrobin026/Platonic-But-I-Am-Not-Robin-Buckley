From: Triscia Vinegas

Happy Valentines Day! 

Dear Noah,
I would like to start my message with gratitude. I am full of gratefulness and words alone cannot comprehend how I feel inside, but I will try to name it through this message. Month of love are not only for lovers but to people you love—platonically, paternal, maternal etc. Thanks for not taking me for granted. A lot of people you know taken advantage of us (me & mica) but you stay true to yourself. You are my first male platonic friend and you kind of remind me of Steve Harrington. We actually watched them from season 1-3 episode 1 only but I watched stranger things again and he reminds me of you, from how he changed to friendships he had with Robin. And it kind of remind me of us (with Mica also) for treating us as humans/people and not different just because we’re female nor we’re way younger. You did not taken advantage of our age. I have to open up this to you, growing up I hate men. They are mean to me and I had bad childhood of them. I once dreamt of having male friend who will treat me rightfully, respectfully, and who’ll treat me as equal. While watching this series, it made me realize the friendship we have. Thanks for respecting us. You are so sweet. I am grateful we did not make into something more and that’s something I’m grateful of, it makes our friendship genuine not performative. You are my first guy friend and it makes myself view it as new perspective of platonic friendship. I was like “this is how it felt like being friends with a grown-ass-man huh?” I laughed. Having friends with you felt like an amusement park. I knew guys are up to adventure, and it is way too different with having female friends. Though, I had male friends before but this is way more genuine. I’m not emotionally connected with them. Either they just want someone to hang out, talk to or secretly wants you or needs you as their therapist. That’s why I liked you, Noah. I liked how imperfectly perfect you are to us which is why you’re just like Steve who had friends that are still in high school. 

In this next paragraph, I know this is hard to open but I knew deep within you’re still not comfortable with me, aren’t you? But like I said, I have to be honest always with my feelings and this is my perspective. You changed so much, for good. We like how wise you are now. But yeah, I know this happened long time ago, but I have to say sorry for what had happened. We all have mistakes but I think I have more guilt. Knowing I have this character that is sweet and gentle, I didn’t think that it sounds informal to a guy—that’s heart already occupied. But when I learnt how opposite gender friendship works, female friendships are different from having guy friends. I should have known girl code that time. The thing is, I casually flirt with my friends and I subconsciously did that to you. But I can’t change myself, right? Unlike Mica, I can’t seem to act like a guy to you. I later realized that Kate seems distant to me. I actually never intended to confess at that time. But I think that you have responsibility to clear everything to Kate though I didn’t know much that time what’s going around you too I just know you must fix it. And because I am a female, I know the feeling of not hearing things clearly. But mind you, my feelings were just superficial, nothing more. I think it was a mistake; I should have keep it that way. I am vulnerable that time maybe. Because of that douchebag guy, he makes me feel like I can never have relationships anymore, but now yeah, I accept that reality. He made me feel trash and unlovable. That’s how I say it was a mistake to interfere with your feelings that’s already taken, ‘cuz I was vulnerable. But things changed Noah, I changed you changed & mica changed. We’re all grown ups now. We’re now able to double check ourselves; from our mistakes and lessons it brought. 

That’s why I think you FOR STILL CHOOSING ME, not romantically but platonically. I will always repeat myself that you made me experience new set of perspectives.

In this last paragraph, I would like you to hear these words I long to say. That I am scared to lose you, my first time. Remember when I always joke or say about what if you finally visit us? Because I had this past trauma that what if you’re just like them… Just like Michael, Stephanie, Kim, Kyle, and Kate from this circle of ours, we treated them real people. It was so unfair since they know who we are and pretended to be genuine. They promised to finally revealed themselves. Now that I’m grown up, it made me realized that they took advantage of our innocence—badly I’m not so innocent anymore, I’m not dumb. Whenever I tell Kyle my weaknesses he used it against me. I used to always say my weakness to them but pretended to be concerned. I used to say I’m easily deceived and they used it against me. But I know you’re not like them, Noah. So please, I want your words to be real. Don’t make promises you aren’t sure about. Be honest even if it hurts us, like why you can’t do this and such. You are not like them so I hope you prove us. I am scared that one day we walked different paths together, that finally you’re graduate now and you met new sets of groups. I hope we never forget each other. 
I am planning to make profit during summer, maybe job hunting? Sidelines to put my savings in my bank account ‘cuz mom haven’t put any since dad died. Whether I got to BU or not, I am prepared. If I got into private school, I don’t want to let my parents down so I will help them. I will try not to ask for allowance anymore. Me and Mica started to be inactive in soc-med in the near future. But I remember you. I don’t want that you forgot us just because we grown apart. I ain’t forgetting you until we finally see each other. Life started getting real in college and you already know that right? We’re not that young anymore. I decided to grow up ‘cuz life is heavy. I hope we still have outlets like telegram, roblox that we can still hangout together. Maybe you might think why we have to do this? Because we don’t want distractions. We want to left behind, a sacrifice in order for us to be focused in our goal. I’ve done this before but I failed ‘cuz my classmates are just so genuine and make me experience life once more as a kid—childhood that were taken away.
I love You Noah. 

My amusement park, full of excitements and joy. My ride or die. Forever soulmates. 
Take care browskie! =) Always.
